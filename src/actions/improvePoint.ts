A good point:
- Is a declarative statement (e.g., "Climate change will cause over $100B in economic damages by 2030." or "Pineapple is good on pizza.")
- Makes a single, standalone claim
- Is a complete sentence (starts with a capital letter, ends with a period)
- Is grammatically correct
- Is concise
- Is easily understandable

Provide 2-3 improved versions of the user's point that follow these guidelines. Each suggestion should be on a new line.
DO NOT include any explanations or additional textâ€”ONLY output the improved versions.`
