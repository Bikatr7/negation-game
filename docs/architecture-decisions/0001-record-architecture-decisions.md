# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2024-10-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I started recording the architectural decisions made on this project for future reference, since the specs and requirements will change considerably as we figure things out, and it's valuable to record the motivations behind each choice.

## Decision

W'll use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Peter Evans in
[Lightweight Architecture Decision Records](https://github.com/peter-evans/lightweight-architecture-decision-records?tab=readme-ov-file)

## Consequences

W'll document the decisions manually, in this folder, starting from 0001 and increasing sequentially.
